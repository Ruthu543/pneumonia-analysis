🫁 Pneumonia Prediction from Chest X-Ray Images

An end-to-end Deep Learning image classification project that analyzes chest X-ray images and predicts whether an image belongs to the Normal or Pneumonia class.

The project covers the complete machine learning lifecycle: dataset analysis, image preprocessing, data augmentation, transfer learning, fine-tuning, model evaluation, model saving, and Flask deployment.

📌 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that can cause visible abnormalities in chest X-ray images. This project explores how Deep Learning and Transfer Learning can be used to build a computer-aided image classification system.

The trained model classifies chest X-ray images into:

🟢 NORMAL

🔴 PNEUMONIA

The final model is integrated into a Flask web application, where users can upload a chest X-ray image and receive a model-generated prediction.

Transfer Learning

The models are compared based on their ability to distinguish between Normal and Pneumonia chest X-ray images.

🔧 Transfer Learning Strategy

Instead of training a Deep Learning model completely from scratch, pretrained CNN architectures are used as the starting point.

Stage 1 — Feature Extraction

The pretrained convolutional layers are initially frozen while custom classification layers are trained.

Pretrained CNN ↓ Frozen Convolutional Layers ↓ Feature Extraction ↓ Custom Classification Layers ↓ NORMAL / PNEUMONIA

Stage 2 — Fine-Tuning

Selected pretrained layers are unfrozen and trained with a lower learning rate.

Pretrained CNN ↓ Selected Layers Unfrozen ↓ Fine-Tuning ↓ Custom Classification Head ↓ NORMAL / PNEUMONIA

Fine-tuning allows the model to learn features that are more specific to chest X-ray images.

🔬 Data Preprocessing

Before training, the X-ray images undergo preprocessing to ensure consistency.

Preprocessing Steps

Load image.

Resize to the required input dimensions.

Normalize pixel values.

Convert images into model-compatible tensors.

Create batches for training.

Assign class labels.

Raw X-Ray ↓ Image Loading ↓ Resize ↓ Normalization ↓ Tensor Conversion ↓ Model Input

🔄 Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is applied to training images to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

Techniques used/explored include:

Horizontal Flip

Rotation

Width Shift

Height Shift

Shearing

Zooming

     Original X-Ray
           │
┌───────────┼───────────┐ ↓ ↓ ↓ Rotation Flip/Shift Shearing │ │ │ └───────────┼───────────┘ ↓ Augmented Images

Data augmentation increases training-data diversity without requiring additional real-world images.

⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling

Class imbalance can cause a model to favor the majority class.

The project analyzes the distribution of Normal and Pneumonia images and can use class weighting during model training.

Example:

class_weights = { 0: 1.05, 1: 0.95 }

The exact weights depend on the class distribution of the training dataset.

📊 Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using multiple classification metrics.

Metric

Purpose

Accuracy

Overall percentage of correct predictions

Precision

Proportion of predicted Pneumonia cases that are actually Pneumonia

Recall

Proportion of actual Pneumonia cases correctly identified

F1-Score

Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall

Confusion Matrix

Detailed breakdown of classification errors

🚨 Why Recall Matters

For a pneumonia-screening use case, recall is particularly important because it measures how many actual Pneumonia cases are correctly identified.

A false negative occurs when:

Actual: PNEUMONIA Predicted: NORMAL

Therefore, model selection should not rely on accuracy alone. Recall, Precision, F1-Score, and the Confusion Matrix should also be considered.
